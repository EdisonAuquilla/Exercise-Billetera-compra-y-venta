## Description

The Digital Wallet project is a system that simulates a digital wallet, allowing users to record their daily transactions, which can be either purchases or sales. Each transaction is characterized by a unique transaction ID, transaction date, transaction type (Purchase or Sale), and transaction amount. The system also calculates and displays the total balance of the wallet, adding income and subtracting registered expenses. This project aims to improve users’ financial planning.

## Features

Record daily transactions (purchases or sales).
Unique transaction ID for each entry.
Transaction date and type (Purchase or Sale).
Calculate and display the total wallet balance.
## Languages and Applications Used: Java, Neatbeans Apache
Hypertext Markup Language
Java
Apache NetBeans
Getting Started
Clone this repository.

## Conclusions about the task:
1.Language and environment: The code is written in Java using NetBeans as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

2.Primary functionality: It handles user events to process purchases within a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

3.Utilized components: It utilizes Java Swing components such as JTextField for inputting amounts, buttons for executing purchases, and JLabel for displaying information such as remaining money.

4.Validation and error handling: It verifies that users input valid numbers and displays error messages when necessary.

5.Logging and visualization: It adds transaction records to a data table, including a random identifier, transaction type, date, and amount.

6.User interaction: It provides visual feedback by updating text labels and displaying pop-up messages as needed.

In summary, the code demonstrates how to develop a simple Java application for purchase management, focusing on user interaction through a graphical interface
## Recommendations about the task:
Learn more about the Java language since there are many things that I still don't know.

learn more about html, it is very useful 

Learn how to correctly create an .exe file
